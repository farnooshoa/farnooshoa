## About me 👋👩‍💻
I’m a data scientist with a background in life sciences and a strong focus on building practical, lightweight tools for extracting insights from messy, complex datasets. Whether I’m working with genomics data, investor profiles, or unstructured online information, I enjoy figuring out how to organize the chaos and surface what actually matters.

My work bridges the technical and the exploratory — I’ve built pipelines to analyze genetic variation, used machine learning to uncover regulatory patterns, and recently started integrating large language models to speed up research and content generation.

I’m especially drawn to projects at the intersection of biotech and information systems: mapping relationships, automating discovery, and creating intuitive ways to explore data. I enjoy the challenge of thinking like both a scientist and a systems builder — always curious, always learning, always iterating.
## What I do 💻

I work at the intersection of data science and biotech, with a focus on building tools that make complex information more accessible and useful. Lately, I've been developing GenAI-powered workflows to support tasks like content generation, investor research, and data enrichment — especially in early-stage biotech contexts.

Most of my projects are about turning unstructured or incomplete data into something meaningful: I’ve built investor-matching tools, genotype analysis pipelines, and NLP-driven research assistants. I enjoy working with both structured data and exploratory problems — whether it’s cleaning large datasets, writing Python scripts to automate repetitive research, or experimenting with LLMs to surface insights faster.

My goal is always the same: simplify the process of finding the right information at the right time — especially when the data is messy, scattered, or siloed.## List of my projects 📑

### List of My Projects 📑


**GenAI Post Generator**  
A Streamlit app that analyzes a LinkedIn influencer’s past posts and uses few-shot learning with LLMs to generate new ones matching their tone and writing style. [Github]((https://github.com/farnooshoa/Linkedin)) 

**Investor Finder**  
Built a keyword-based investor-matching engine that parses and ranks investor profiles based on biotech modality, stage, and geography. Includes a proof-of-concept data enrichment pipeline for fund size, investment focus, and modality. [Github](https://github.com/farnooshoa/Streamlit-app)

**DNA and Genomic Toolkits**  
Modular Python scripts for DNA/RNA transcription, GC-content, peptide properties, and k-mer searches — built for flexible reuse in bioinformatics pipelines. [Github](https://github.com/farnooshoa/DNA-and-Genomic-toolkits)

**Genotype PCA Analysis**  
Pipelines for analyzing VCF genotype files, visualizing genetic diversity, and applying topic modeling to uncover regulatory trends in gene expression data. [Github](https://github.com/farnooshoa/PCA-ON-GENOMTYPE)

**NGS Data Processing Pipeline**  
Developed a Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data processing pipeline, utilizing tools such as Cutadapt, BWA, FreeBayes, and Python for trimming, alignment, variant calling, and data visualization. [Github](https://github.com/farnooshoa/NGS-Data)

**Gene Expression and Regulatory Topic Modeling**  
Data preprocessing, gene expression analysis, and topic modeling using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to identify regulatory mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets. [Github](https://github.com/farnooshoa/gene-expression)
